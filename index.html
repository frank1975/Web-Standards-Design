    <h3><a href="http://www.golftec.com">GolfTEC Lessons</a></h3>
    <p> If you want to play better golf, you have come to the right place. For more
	than 15 years, GolfTEC has been helping golfers of all skill levels play better 
	and enjoy the game more. Whether you are a complete beginner or an accomplished 
	golfer, GolfTEC’s comprehensive approach to improvement can help you reach your 
	personal goals. GolfTEC is the only place you need for golf improvement. Build proper 
	swing mechanics,menjoy the game more and lower your scores with GolfTEC lessons. Increase 
	driving distance and accuracy with every club in your bag with GolfTEC’s Personal Club Fitting.</p>
	
	<p>You want to play better golf. GolfTEC will help you make it happen. Join the more than 
	200,000 clients who have found success with GolfTEC’s Proven Path. Call a GolfTEC Improvement 
	Center near you to talk to a GolfTEC Coach about getting started. GolfTEC's approach to golf lessons 
	not only makes sense—it works. Combined, more than 200,000 golfers have experienced a 95% success rate 
	following GolfTEC's Proven Path. And each year, thousands of golfers make GolfTEC's Wall of Fame. Some 
	win club championships. Some shoot career rounds. Many find more fairways and lose fewer balls. And 
	others are simply able to do what they could not do before taking a GolfTEC lesson—enjoy the game of golf.</p>
	
	<p>From day one, GolfTEC has believed in the power of using advanced technology to accelerate the golf 
	improvement process. GolfTEC's patented g-SWING system combines digital video, motion measurement and 
	biofeedback. It doesn't end there. Each golf lesson you take is uploaded to your personalized Player 
	Performance Center using GolfTEC's WebLesson® technology, giving you 24/7 access to your lesson history, 
	past swing videos, practice drills and more. The bottom line: Each GolfTEC lesson utilizes advanced technology 
	to dramatically accelerate your improvement. Let's face it; the driver is the most difficult club in your bag to hit. 
	With lofts of about 10° on most drivers, any deviations on swing path or club face will have exponentially higher 
	negative consequences. A swing with a wedge may end up missing a green, while that same swing with a driver will 
	end up knee deep in the long stuff.</p>
